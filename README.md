# General Info

General info regarding the IPDGC, its GitHub site plus current and past projects.

## Basic structure of this site

We are generally focused on 1 general types of repositories:
1. General use code.
  This could be an example script that accomplishes some basic task like cleaning genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, executing a meta-analysis of summary statistics or calcualting a polygenic risk score (PRS).
   These should focus on general applicability and use in a variety of scenarios.
   This is usually a shorter workflow or single script.
2. Project specific code.
  This is where the entire set of code for a paper / project can be stored.
  This promotes progress, transparency and reproducability.
  Additionally this also helps reduce work redundancy within the collaborative group.

## General conventions for repositories

Call your repository something unique / meaningful (don't just call it "GWAS stuff") and briefly describe the planned content in a few sentances.
All repositories should have a readme markdown containing this information plus other important notes.
Tag the programming languages the repository uses.

## Some notes on style

If nobody understands what you are doing, then your code is pretty much useless.
### Provide comments and usages examples!
Also, following google style guides are pretty helpful.
